# Trojan
This is a client version coded in C++ for Windows.

It uses UDP.
It is also compatible with a Java server.
There isn't any authentification, everybody who knows the opened port on the remote client could send any command, then executed it as a user or superuser (if launched with these rights).

This is only for test purpose like "trolling" friends for a few seconds. (and then uninstall it)
Stuff for launching it and hiding it can be found on the web. I won't share the stuff I found otherwise it won't remain ethical hacking.
